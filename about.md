# Arion Zimmermann

I'm an Electrical Engineer and researcher specializing in autonomous systems, with particular expertise in perception, localization, motion planning, and power system design for aerospace and robotics applications.

## Current Role

**Associate Research Engineer** at Caltech (2024-present)  
Working under Prof. Soon-Jo Chung on cutting-edge autonomous racing technology, developing robust perception and motion planning algorithms for high-speed autonomous race cars capable of real-time decision making at speeds up to 300km/h.

## Background

I completed my MSc in Electrical Engineering at EPFL (2018-2024) with a minor in Space Technologies. My Master's thesis, conducted at Caltech under Prof. Soon-Jo Chung's supervision, focused on pose estimation of unknown tumbling bodies in space environments - research with direct applications to autonomous space debris removal, satellite servicing, and asteroid proximity operations.

## Research Interests

My research spans several interconnected areas:

**Perception & State Estimation**: Developing multi-modal sensor fusion algorithms, robust estimation techniques that maintain performance under sensor failures, and factor graph optimization for large-scale SLAM problems.

**Space Robotics & Autonomous Systems**: Working on on-orbit servicing, planetary exploration autonomy, and formation flying coordination between multiple spacecraft.

**Power Systems Engineering**: Designing high-reliability, fault-tolerant power systems optimized for efficiency, throughput, and resilience in extreme environments.

## Notable Achievements

### Competition Success
- **3rd place** at European Rover Challenge 2023 World Finals (Best Robotic Arm Award)
- **2nd place** at European Rover Challenge 2022 World Finals (Best Autonomous Navigation Award)  
- **1st place** at EuRoC International Rocketry Competition 2021
- **3rd fastest lap time** at Laguna Seca Indie Autonomous Challenge

### Academic Recognition
- **$10K Athena Program Scholarship** from University of Geneva for highest grade in Electrodynamics
- **MIT Primes-Switzerland** mathematics program participant
- Multiple podium finishes in programming competitions

## Leadership & Impact

### EPFL Xplore (2020-2023)
As co-founder of Switzerland's largest robotics student association, I led teams of 60+ students in developing autonomous rovers, drones, and power systems. My roles included:
- **Co-founder & Visionary** (2020): Establishing the organization's mission and securing $150K+ annual funding
- **Project Manager & Vice-President** (2021-2022): Managing budgets, timelines, and cross-functional teams
- **Systems Engineer** (2020-2023): Designing electrical architectures, power systems, and software frameworks

### EPFL Rocket Team (2019-2021)
Led the avionics team for hybrid rocket development, resulting in successful launches and international competition victories.

## Technical Expertise

**Robotics & AI**: ROS/ROS2, PCL, Computer Vision, Neural Networks, SLAM, Kalman Filtering, MPC, Factor Graphs

**Electronics**: Altium Designer, KiCad, FPGA development (VHDL/Verilog), Power Electronics, Embedded Systems

**Software**: C/C++, Python, MATLAB, Real-time Systems, Communication Protocols, Embedded Linux

**Specialized Systems**: Space-grade electronics, SDR, Quantum Key Distribution satellites, Autonomous Navigation

## Current Focus

I'm currently advancing the state-of-the-art in autonomous racing while actively seeking PhD opportunities to continue pushing the boundaries of robotics and autonomous systems. My work combines theoretical rigor with practical validation in competitive environments that provide objective performance metrics.

## International Experience

My research has taken me across multiple continents, including collaborations between Caltech and EPFL, internships in Singapore's quantum satellite industry, and participation in international competitions across Europe and North America.
