# About Me

I'm Arion Zimmermann, a robotics engineer with a passion for autonomous systems and aerospace applications. My journey spans from designing rocket avionics to developing perception algorithms for autonomous race cars, always with a focus on pushing the boundaries of what's possible in robotics and space technology.

## Professional Experience

### Research Engineer - Caltech (2024)
Currently working on robust perception and motion planning algorithms for autonomous race cars participating in the Indie Autonomous Challenge. My focus is on developing reliable systems that can operate at high speeds in dynamic environments.

### Electrical Engineer Intern - SpeQtral, Singapore (2023)
Developed FPGA systems and PCB designs for Quantum Key Distribution LEO satellites, contributing to the next generation of secure space-based communication systems.

### Research & Teaching Assistant - EPFL (2020-2023)
Conducted research on ultra-wideband angle-of-arrival localization strategies under the supervision of Prof. Andreas Burg. Also served as a teaching assistant for multiple courses including Physics III: Electrodynamics, Embedded Systems, and Electronics II.

## Education & Research

I completed my MSc in Electrical Engineering at EPFL (2018-2024) with a minor in Space Technologies. My thesis work focused on pose estimation of unknown tumbling bodies under the supervision of Prof. Soon-Jo Chung at Caltech and Prof. Colin Jones at EPFL.

My research interests center around:
- **Autonomous Systems**: Perception, motion planning, and control
- **Space Robotics**: Pose estimation, localization, and navigation
- **System Architecture**: Redundant power systems and real-time embedded systems
- **Sensor Fusion**: Multi-modal perception and state estimation

## Leadership

### Co-founder, EPFL Xplore (2020)
Co-founded EPFL's largest robotics student association, growing it to hundreds of members developing rovers, drones, and legged robots for international competitions. Served in various leadership roles including Systems Engineer, Project Manager and Vice-President.

### Avionics Team Leader, EPFL Rocket Team (2020-2021)
Led the avionics development for hybrid rockets, culminating in a 1st place victory at the EuRoC international competition in 2021.

## Competition Achievements

My teams and I have achieved significant success in international robotics and aerospace competitions:
- **3Ã— ERC Robotics Competition** podium finishes (2021-2023)
- **1st place EuRoC Rocketry Competition** (2021)
- **Multiple special prizes** for autonomous navigation and robotic arm design

## Technical Philosophy

I believe in building robust, reliable systems that can operate in challenging, real-world environments. Whether it's a rover navigating Martian-like terrain, a rocket launching into space, or a race car navigating at high speeds, the principles remain the same: careful system design, thorough testing, and intelligent algorithms that can adapt to uncertainty.
