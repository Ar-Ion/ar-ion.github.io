I'm Arion Zimmermann, a robotics researcher with a passion for autonomous systems and aerospace applications. My journey spans from designing rovers to developing perception algorithms for autonomous race cars, always with a focus on pushing the boundaries of what's possible in robotics for extreme environments. [**Have a look at my CV!**](/assets/docs/cv_v5.pdf){:target="_blank"}

## Professional Experience

### Research Engineer - Caltech (2024)
Currently working on robust perception and localization algorithms for autonomous race cars participating in the Indy Autonomous Challenge. My focus is on developing reliable autonomous software stacks that can operate at high speeds and low-latency in dynamic environments.

### Systems Engineering Intern - SpeQtral, Singapore (2023)
Contributed to system validation campaign and firmware architecture for Quantum Key Distribution LEO satellites, contributing to the next generation of secure space-based communication systems.

### Research & Teaching Assistant - EPFL (2020-2023)
Conducted research on ultra-wideband angle-of-arrival localization strategies under the supervision of Prof. Andreas Burg. Also served as a teaching assistant for multiple courses including Electrodynamics, Embedded Systems, and Electronics II.

## Education & Research

I completed my MSc in Electrical Engineering at EPFL (2018-2024) with a minor in Space Technologies. My thesis work focused on pose estimation of unknown tumbling bodies under the supervision of Prof. Soon-Jo Chung at Caltech and Prof. Colin Jones at EPFL. [*More info here*](research/#pose-estimation-of-unknown-tumbling-bodies-2024).

My interests center around:
- **Agile Autonomous Systems**: Perception and localization algorithms for highly dynamic systems
- **Aerospace Robotics**: Robotic systems design for extreme environments
- **System Architecture**: High-level formalization and design of complex systems
- **Sensor Fusion**: Multi-modal perception and state estimation

## Leadership

### Co-founder, EPFL Xplore (2020)
Co-founded EPFL's largest robotics student association, growing it to hundreds of members developing rovers, drones, and legged robots for international competitions. Served in various leadership roles including Systems Engineer, Project Manager and Vice-President.

### Avionics Team Leader, EPFL Rocket Team (2020-2021)
Led the avionics development for hybrid rockets, culminating in a 1st place victory at the EuRoC international competition in 2021.

## Competition Achievements

My teams and I have achieved significant success in international robotics and aerospace competitions:
- **3Ã— ERC Robotics Competition** podium finishes with special prizes (2021-2023)
- **1st place EuRoC Rocketry Competition** (2021)

## Technical Philosophy

I believe in building robust, reliable and efficient systems that can operate in extreme environments. Whether it's a rover navigating Martian-like terrain, a rocket launching into space, or a race car navigating at high speeds, the principles remain the same: careful system design, thorough testing, and efficient algorithms that can adapt to uncertainty.
